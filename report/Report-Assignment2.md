This report comprises the hatch cover design for a bulk carrier as part of the 2<sup>nd</sup> assignment of Ship Structure Design lectures. 

With the inputs provided by Prof. Andric, the <i>IACS - CSR for Bulk Carriers</i> and <i>LR's Additional Design Procedures - Assessment of Steel Hatch Covers Using Finite Element Analysis </i> it was possible to design a hatch cover and simulate its behavior when subjected to the water pressure that acts on ship deck. The calculations and report were made using Python language and Jupyter computing environment while the hatch cover modeling and FEM simulations were performed with FEMAP/Nastran software. 

The report contains the code used to perform the calculations and checks. At the end of the design it was accomplished a solution compling with all rule and weight requirements.
